# Bank Customer Churn Model

**Churn Modelling** - How to predict if a bankâ€™s customer will stay or leave the bank?
Customer churn is important because it costs more to acquire new customers than to deal with existing customers. 

Using a source of 10,000 bank records, implementation of machine learning models is done to predict the likelihood of customer churn. 

## Dataset -

The dataset used is available at : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shrutimechlearn/churn-modelling

This data set contains details of a bank's customers and the target variable is a binary variable reflecting the fact whether the customer 
left the bank (closed his account) or he continues to be a customer.

Steps perfomed for customer churn model are -
- Data import
- Data preprocessing
- Data visualization
- Data encoding
- Data Balancing
- Data standardization
- Machine Learning model
- Model Evaluation
- Hyperparameter Tuning
